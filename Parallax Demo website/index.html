        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>Jack Dorsey, the inventor of Twitter and now multi-millionaire, had humble beginnings, always wanting to make a difference and connect people throughout the world. He lived in St. Louis Missouri with his parents, who had a strong passion for the city. Their love of St. Louis passed onto Dorsey, who became obsessed with maps and learning the city. Once his family owned a police scanner, he used it linked to a computer to track traffic patterns and crimes in real time, beginning his fixation with computers. He was amazed by the technology, and although he originally had wanted to be a mayor since he loved the city, his ability to influence the world quickly through programming computers overruled his political desires. He began to hack computers and eventually hacked into a programming company in New York, later emailing them that they had a hole in their website and letting them know that he was a programmer in need of a job. The company hired him, and he met people who shared his vision of creating something that could connect the world together. On the side, they began to create what we now know as twitter.</p>

        <h1>The Purpose of Twitter</h1>
        <p>Dorsey's desire to connect the world resulted in the creation of Twitter. He intended and succeeded in designing a program in which people could publish their opinions and see what other people thought throughout the world in real time. He also was driven by his mother, whom he wanted to keep updated on his life. Twitter, according to Dorsey, makes the world small and lets everyone's opinions matter.</p>

        <h1>Why 140 Characters?</h1>
        <p>Twitter was intended to show people's opinions in real time, not something that people could write paragraph, in depth stories about their lives. It makes people more creative and it forces them to live in and concentrate on the moment.</p>
